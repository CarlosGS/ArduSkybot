ArduSkyBot demo code  
--  
Code for demonstrating the basic functionality of the ArduSkyBot.

1. At the beginning the robot will make a sound and the orange LED will light up.
2. Then you can select an option (with the push button):
    * Orange LED: Distance harp
    * Red LED: Line follower
    * Green LED: Light follower (with obstacle avoidance)
    * Yellow LED: Obstacle avoidance
3. Wait for 5 seconds, the robot will make a sound and the selected LED will blink.
4. Press the button to launch the program.
